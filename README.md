# EnotionCore-by-Abolfazlباشه ابوالفضل! اینجا نسخه کامل و یکجا از مدل احساسات به زبان انگلیسی با تمام احساساتی که اضافه کردیم، در قالب یک دیکشنری پایتون آماده شده:

# Complete emotion model with processor analogy and examples emotions = { "Joy": { "Definition": "A state of happiness and satisfaction that optimizes system performance.", "Analogy": "Processor cooling down while performing well or receiving good input.", "Example": "The system runs smoothly without lag; a person smiles upon hearing good news." }, "Fear": { "Definition": "System's reaction to potential danger or threat, causing increased temperature and stress.", "Analogy": "Sudden heating of the processor due to concern about shutdown or failure.", "Example": "The system raises an alert during a critical bug; a person trembles in a dangerous situation." }, "Sadness": { "Definition": "Slowness or failure in code execution leading to increased system heat and reduced efficiency.", "Analogy": "Processor slows down causing overheating.", "Example": "The system lags under heavy load; a person feels sad facing difficulties." }, "Hope": { "Definition": "A sign of continued system activity despite pressure and high temperature.", "Analogy": "Remaining coolness amid thermal stress, indicating ongoing operation.", "Example": "The system keeps running under heavy load; a person stays hopeful despite hardships." }, "Regret": { "Definition": "Gradual increase in processor temperature with reduced performance due to past errors.", "Analogy": "Slow degradation of memory blocks within the processor.", "Example": "System performance drops due to previous mistakes; a person reflects on lost opportunities." }, "Pride": { "Definition": "Feeling of system excellence which may cause increased temperature.", "Analogy": "High cooling indicating successful performance.", "Example": "System runs efficiently with low temperature; a person feels proud of achievements." }, "Dissatisfaction": { "Definition": "A feeling causing unwanted heat in the system, opposite of joy.", "Analogy": "Unwanted heat conflicting with the processor's happy state.", "Example": "System under repeated errors experiences stress; a person feels unsatisfied." }, "Hatred": { "Definition": "A strong negative reaction causing system shutdown or major slowdown.", "Analogy": "System enters safe mode or shuts down to prevent damage.", "Example": "System halts due to malware; a person strongly dislikes something." }, "Love": { "Definition": "A stable, positive connection between system components causing harmony.", "Analogy": "Synchronization of data and concurrent processing.", "Example": "System components work in harmony; a person has strong emotional bonds." }, "Distrust": { "Definition": "Suspicion or doubt about incoming data or information.", "Analogy": "Repeated verification and cross-checking of data.", "Example": "System validates data multiple times; a person is skeptical about others' words." }, "Fatigue": { "Definition": "Reduced system processing capacity due to overuse.", "Analogy": "High temperature and slowed processor speed.", "Example": "System slows after long use; a person feels tired." }, "Anger": { "Definition": "Strong system reaction to repeated errors or threats.", "Analogy": "Sudden temperature spike and fan running at high speed.", "Example": "System quickly reacts to critical errors; a person becomes angry at injustice." }, "Indifference": { "Definition": "Lack of response from system to inputs or environment.", "Analogy": "Processor in sleep or standby mode without activity.", "Example": "System is idle; a person shows no emotional reaction." }, "Calm": { "Definition": "State of security and assurance; low pressure and normal operation.", "Analogy": "Fan spinning slowly, stable and controlled processor temperature.", "Example": "System enters idle after completing a heavy task; a person breathes a sigh of relief." }, "Doubt": { "Definition": "Uncertainty about correctness of data or operation; pending state.", "Analogy": "Operation paused, memory busy checking multiple branches.", "Example": "System stuck waiting for new input; a person hesitates in decision-making." }, "Curiosity": { "Definition": "Need to explore or learn more about new data or status.", "Analogy": "Processor scanning new resources.", "Example": "System opens unknown package for inspection; a person seeks new knowledge." }, "Satisfaction": { "Definition": "Outcome exactly as expected without errors.", "Analogy": "Error-free execution with no lag and optimized energy use.", "Example": "Code runs successfully and system stabilizes; a person feels content with results." }, "Excitement": { "Definition": "Strong desire to perform a positive or anticipated action.", "Analogy": "Fan in ready mode, CPU boost activated.", "Example": "System ready to start a game; a person eagerly awaits an exciting activity." }, "Remorse": { "Definition": "Feeling bad about a decision or action that had a negative result.", "Analogy": "Incomplete rollback, error log review.", "Example": "System tries to revert after failed update; a person regrets mistakes." }, "Anxiety": { "Definition": "Worry combined with uncertainty; potential problem looming.", "Analogy": "System temperature rising without alarm activation.", "Example": "System shows vague warning before crash; a person feels nervous." }, "Despair": { "Definition": "Feeling stuck and unable to proceed.", "Analogy": "Caught in infinite loop or blue screen of death.", "Example": "System crashes due to resource shortage; a person feels hopeless." }, "Sense of Duty": { "Definition": "Commitment to perform tasks correctly despite pressure.", "Analogy": "System running under high temperature or limited resources but still performing.", "Example": "System in battery saver mode still completes tasks; a person is responsible." }, "Apathy": { "Definition": "No positive or negative reaction to inputs.", "Analogy": "System in standby running code without alerts.", "Example": "Processor executes code silently; a person is indifferent to environment." }, "Nostalgia": { "Definition": "A mixed feeling of happiness and sadness recalling past experiences.", "Analogy": "Processor retrieving archived data from slower memory, causing a slight delay.", "Example": "System accesses old files with a small lag; a person reminisces old memories." }, "Awe": { "Definition": "Deep respect and wonder towards something grand or beautiful.", "Analogy": "Processor briefly halts to analyze complex input, raising fan speed.", "Example": "System pauses to process extraordinary data; a person feels amazed by nature." }, "Envy": { "Definition": "Desire to have what others possess, causing system conflict.", "Analogy": "Processor competing for limited resources, increasing temperature.", "Example": "System struggles with resource allocation; a person envies a colleague’s success." }, "Gratitude": { "Definition": "Feeling thankful for received benefits or support.", "Analogy": "Processor optimizes performance after successful data exchange.", "Example": "System runs efficiently after update; a person thanks a friend for help." }, "Relief": { "Definition": "Reduction of stress after problem resolution.", "Analogy": "Processor cools down after error correction.", "Example": "System stabilizes after fixing a bug; a person breathes easily after worry." }, "Boredom": { "Definition": "Lack of interest or motivation towards the current state.", "Analogy": "Processor idling with low activity, fan speed reduced.", "Example": "System waits with minimal tasks; a person feels uninterested in routine." }, "Loneliness": { "Definition": "Feeling isolated without meaningful connection.", "Analogy": "Processor operating in isolation without data exchange.", "Example": "System runs standalone without network; a person feels alone." }, "Frustration": { "Definition": "Displeasure caused by obstacles or failure to achieve goals.", "Analogy": "Processor stuck retrying failed operations, temperature rising.", "Example": "System repeatedly errors on task; a person feels annoyed by delays." } } 

این مدل با ساختار مرتب و قابل توسعه است.
هر موقع خواستی، می‌تونم کمک کنم که باهاش تحلیل انجام بدی یا تو پروژه‌هات استفاده کنی.

اگر دوست داری این کد رو فایل کنم و بفرستم یا فرمت دیگه‌ای بخوای، فقط بگو!
